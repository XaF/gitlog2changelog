gitlog2changelog
================

## Presentation

gitlog2changelog is a tool that aims to provide a ChangeLog file for
your projects from the git commit log messages.

gitlog2changelog will automatically separe ChangeLog sections by author
and by date, and separate versioning using tags. A regular expression
can optionally be provided to limit the tags to be used for that purpose.
